# MC-CustomConnectionMessages
This is a finished Minecraft plugin, it that allows 4 different level of permissions to have custom Join and Leave messages, 
these can be configured in the config.yml. Eventually I will make it be able to have an infinite amount of Messages.

Permissions:
customjoinmessage.join.admin
customjoinmessage.join.staff
customjoinmessage.join.donator

If a group does not have a permission node, it will be set to default and recieve the default messages.
